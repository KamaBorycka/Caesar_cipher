# Caesar_cipher
A Caesar Cipher is a simple way of encoding messages that involves replacing each letter in the text by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 

For example if you choose a shift of 3, then the letter "A" will be replaced by letter "D". 

In order to run this program, run `python3 caesar_cipher.py`

## Example
Message "hello world" would be encrypted as "khoor zruog" using a Ceasar Cipher with a shift of 3.

Input:
Hello world

Output:
khoor zruog
